    "hero_intro": "I'm a strategist and narrative architect. I discover foundational stories, clarify direction, and build strategy into compelling narratives and action. I work with founders, executives, and creative leaders navigating transitions — offering thought partnership, strategic clarity, and narrative development for people doing work that matters.",
    "the_work": [
      "Storytelling is business strategy and vision work. It preexists product decisions and informs design, path, and culture. Instead, it's treated as downstream communication.",
      "Every organization and venture has a narrative thread running through it — embedded in the culture, the product, the pricing, the org chart, how you hire, how you spend your time. Most of the time, nobody has named it. I read that thread. I check whether it's true. And I help you build from it.",
      "I see narrative gaps before anyone else does. When story, strategy, and operations are aligned — when the thread holds — things work. People feel it. Customers feel it. The team can articulate what they're doing and why without a script.",
      "My work is finding the thread, checking if it's true, and helping you build from it. The looking and the doing aren't separate phases. To see clearly is already to start moving."
    ],
    "come_cloudy_body": "Our favorite collaborators are talented, ambitious leaders in foggy conditions who could use a mirror, divining rod, or compass tune-up — the perfect name for your next solid step forward. I illuminate the unseen. I help you see patterns you can't see from inside, surface what's implicit, translate murky vision into clarity.",
    "about_preview_p1": "I've spent my career helping organizations navigate periods of significant change. My background spans product strategy at TED, management consulting at Incandescent (including facilitation at the White House), and years of advisory for enterprises, startups, and creative leaders in transition.",
    "about_preview_p2": "I operate as a consigliere — a trusted voice in the room with leadership who names what others can't yet see.",
    "about_preview_p3": "Light Work Studios is a creative consultancy and studio practice — strategic advisory, narrative work, and creative projects for leaders building into the unknown."

      "I've spent my career helping organizations navigate periods of significant change. My background spans product strategy at TED, management consulting at Incandescent (including facilitation at the White House), and years of advisory for enterprises, startups, and creative leaders in transition.",
      "My background spans operational leadership, strategic advising, and organizational design, all informed by an ongoing creative practice and deep interest in how systems evolve and adapt.",
      "I believe the most important insights often emerge from the spaces between conventional metrics — the human dynamics, cultural nuances, and unspoken patterns that shape how organizations actually function. I see narrative gaps before anyone else does. And I know how to name them in a way that moves things forward."
    ],
    "how_i_work": [
      "I serve as a trusted advisor — a consigliere — rather than a traditional coach or consultant. I'm a collaborator in the room with leadership who names what others can't yet see, and helps break up the in-groupness of teams that have been too close to their own work for too long.",
      "My engagements are designed to be high-impact, focused, and tailored to your specific context. I limit my client roster to ensure deep engagement and real availability for each partnership."

    "studio": [
      "Light Work Studios is a creative consultancy and studio practice. Among its offerings is a curated advisory practice for founders, leaders, and creative people whose ambitions outpace the language they currently have for them.",
      "I have a degree in English literature from Duke University, a book in progress about postpartum neuroplasticity and language acquisition, and a Substack called Light Table. I write because the most important stories are the ones nobody has articulated yet."

    "emerging_tech": [
      "Emerging technology is reshaping how organizations work, tell their stories, and serve their people. Before you invest, do you know what narrative your organization carries well enough to know where technology serves it — and where it would be rejected?",
      "Most AI adoption starts from the tool and works backward. I start from the organism — the identity, the culture, the operations — and work forward. Narrative-led technology alignment means starting from who you are, not from what's trending. This is available as part of any engagement or as a standalone assessment."
    ],
    "page_subtitle": "As part of Light Work's advising, I offer different depths of engagement. The shape of the work emerges from what you're navigating.",
    "consigliere_description": "Ongoing retained advisory — like adding a trusted voice to your board, or creating a board where you don't have one. Regular rhythm, full async access, and the kind of honest, wide-ranging counsel that keeps your thinking sharp across every dimension of what you're building. For leaders who want a strategic partner for the season, not just a project.",
    "scholarship_note": "I believe good counsel should be available to those doing important work. I reserve a small number of spots each season for sliding scale and scholarship engagements — if cost is a barrier, reach out.",
    "session_description": "A short intake call and inputs download, followed by a full working session. Full attention, and some interstitial work. This is designed especially to provide ongoing ad hoc support for clients. Come with a question, a decision, a knot, and we can work it together and leave you sharper. Choose the Bookend Session to pressure-test a new question, address a specific crossroads, or when you need to re-up on outside the room intuition.",
    "residency_description": "Three months of steady strategic partnership. Regular sessions, light async access, and a consistent rhythm of support and clarity. I'm a tuning fork for your direction — helping you hear what's already there and move with confidence. You leave with an artifact that captures what we've surfaced together. This is where most engagements begin.",
    "how_it_goes": [
      "I begin with discovery — part spelunking, part research, part conversation. The work begins immediately, and the shape of the engagement emerges as we unlock insights. Within days, we're boots on the ground together, capturing what will inform the next several years of your strategy.",
      "Whether we're working on personal direction, organizational narrative, or something entirely bespoke, it starts the same way: I listen for the thread."
    ],
    "incubator_description": "Co-building and sleeves rolled up, this is the deepest mode. I like to think of it as co-founder-for-hire. Your venture takes up residence in the Light Work core focus. Incubator advising has a limited number of slots per season, to facilitate embedded collaboration, fractional leadership, and creative direction. This is the right mode for launches, new chapters, and builds that need a strategic co-creator, not just an advisor. We design the structure together around what you're making.",
    "cta_italic": "Mirror, divining rod, or compass tune-up — whatever you need, it starts with a conversation."

    "intro": "Start with a conversation. We'll talk about what you're navigating and whether there's a good fit.",
    "session_description": "A short intake call followed by a full working session. Full attention, no ongoing commitment. Good for a pressure-test, a specific crossroads, or when you need someone outside the room to tell you what they see.",
    "scholarship_note": "I reserve a small number of spots each season for sliding scale and scholarship engagements. If cost is a barrier to access, email me."
