        <p>Storytelling is business strategy and vision work. It preexists product decisions and informs design, path, and culture. Instead, it's treated as downstream communication.</p>
        <p>Every organization and venture has a narrative thread running through it — embedded in the culture, the product, the pricing, the org chart, how you hire, how you spend your time. Most of the time, nobody has named it. I read that thread. I check whether it's true. And I help you build from it.</p>
        <p>I see narrative gaps before anyone else does. When story, strategy, and operations are aligned — when the thread holds — things work. People feel it. Customers feel it. The team can articulate what they're doing and why without a script.</p>
        <p>My work is finding the thread, checking if it's true, and helping you build from it. The looking and the doing aren't separate phases. To see clearly is already to start moving.</p>
